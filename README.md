# Gatsby CETEIcean Starter

A Gatbys starter with gatsby-theme-CETEIcean and gatsby-transformer-CETEIcean.

Mostly meant for pedagogical uses.

## Installation

Make sure you have NodeJS installed.

With the project folder open in VS Code, access the terminal and type:

```js
npm install
```

This will take a few minutes.

## Development

To work on your site, run Gastby so that it will show changes as you make them.

With the project folder open in VS Code, access the terminal and type:

```js
npm run develop
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

## Troubleshooting

If the site is behaving unexpectedly, you can try to stop and restart Gastby. You can do this by accessing the terminal with Gatsby running and hitting Ctrl+C to stop Gatsby. Then start again (see Development above).

If you're still encountering issues, you can try and clean existing pre-generated data with the following command from the terminal:

```js
npm run clean
```

## Local build (optional)

To have a look at how the built static site looks like you can also build the website locally.

With the project folder open in VS Code, access the terminal and type:

```js
npm run build-local
```
